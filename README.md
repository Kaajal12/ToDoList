# ToDoList
iOS App constructed using Segues, Core Data, Actions/Outlets, & Storyboards

Overview: In the To Do List mobile application, created in Kode with Klossy the user can enter in their tasks that need to be completed. By implementing the switch component, the user
can turn it on if their task is considered important.

Features: The app uses core data, meaning that the data will be saved once the user exits the app, multiple navigation controllers to switch between pages,
add in new tasks, mark old tasks as complete, and a toggle switch button. With this app, it keeps the user organized to sort out their tasks and mark them
as complete upon completion of the task.

Note: This iOS app was designed and constructed using Xcode and Swift.
